DEPENDENT & INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the function lm(formula = avg_time ~ distance , data =  rs) avg_time is the “response variable” (what we are trying to predict) distance is the “predictor variable” (what we are using to predict the response variable). 

avg_time is also known as the “dependent variable” where again the dependent variable is what you measure in the experiment and what is affected during the experiment. The dependent variable responds to the independent variable. It is called dependent because it "depends" on the independent variable. The predictor is also known as the “independent variable” where again it is variable that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables you are trying to measure.

independent variables are denoted by y
dependent variables are denoted by x
